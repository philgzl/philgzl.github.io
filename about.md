# About me

I am a PhD student in the Hearing Systems section in the department of Health Technology at the Technical University of Denmark, supervised by Tobias May and Tommy Sonne Alstr√∏m. My research interests include audio signal processing, deep learning-based speech enhancement and source separation, and generalization of learning-based systems.

I had the chance to live in 6 different countries and visit 31 more. I speak English, French, Spanish and some Danish. I wish I didn't spend so much time playing video games and instead was better with electronics, photography, tennis, chess and bass guitar. I love music and dogs.
