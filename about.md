# About me

I am a PhD student in the Hearing Systems section in the department of Health Technology at the Technical University of Denmark. My main research interests are audio signal processing and deep learning applied to speech enhancement.

I had the chance to live in 6 different countries and visit 31 more of them. I speak French, Spanish and English and am currently learning Danish.

I am a huge music nerd, or at least I think I am. I wish I didn't spend so much time playing Dota 2 and instead was better with electronics, photography, tennis, chess and bass guitar. I love dogs.
